# Shared Notes

This repository is intended to be used as a shared space for the team to share notes, ideas, and other information.

## How to Use

1. Create a new file in the relevant directory with the name of the date you want to add a note for. For example, if you want to add meeting notes for September 10th, 2023, create a file named `2023-09-10.md` within the `meetings/2023/09` directory
2. Add your note to the file you created.
3. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
4. Done!

## Real-Time Collaboration

If you want to collaborate with someone else on notes in real-time, you can use the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension for VS Code. This will allow you to share your workspace with someone else, and they will be able to edit the files alongside you, with visible cursors, text and highlighting appearing in real-time.

## Note Types

### Meeting Notes

Meeting notes should be added to the `meetings` directory, organized in subfolders by year and month. The file name should be the date of the meeting in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. For example, if you want to add meeting notes for September 10th, 2023, create a file named `2023-09-10.md`.

### Ideas

Ideas should be added to the `ideas` directory, with clear and descriptive file names. For example, if you have an idea for a new video upload feature, create a file named `video-upload.md`.

### Topics

Topics should be added to the `topics` directory, with clear and descriptive file names. For example, if you want to discuss the future of the app, create a file named `app-future-plans.md`.

### Documentation

Documentation should be added to the `documentation` directory, with clear and descriptive file names. For example, if you want to document the process for creating a new account, create a file named `create-account.md`.

### Other

If you have a note that doesn't fit into any of the above categories, you can add it to the `other` directory. Please try to keep the file names as clear and descriptive as possible.

## File Format

All notes should be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). This is a simple markup language that allows you to add formatting to text, such as bold, italics, headings, and more. It is very easy to learn, and you can find a guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
